    <h2>Let's play</h2>

    <p>
      I am the youngest child of my house. Due to my condition, I have learned to use my wit and
      intellect to overcome the prejudice I have to face all the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have had a very tough life. My father despites me. Many people tried to murder me during my
      whole life. Among them, my sister, after being falsely accused of poisoning my nephew. I was
      lucky then, and my brother saved me. Since then, I have lived in exile and now I serve the
      enemy of my house.

      You may remember what I said at my trial, when I was falsely accused of killing my nephew, the
      King:
      <q cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060910/quotes">
        I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime: I'm guilty of being a dwarf!
      </q>
